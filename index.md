# About me

I am Javier Guzman and I am a software engineer with passion for traveling, photography and reading. I like jogging in the morning and I am a coffee/tea lover.

My main experience is in the embedded software domain, however, in 2020, I left my life in the UK and learnt all about web technologies by myself. I failed to create my first startup, Kindoi, which was meant to sort out your travel itineraries within seconds. Since then, I have been deploying more ideas while looking for a job.

Currently living in Europe.
